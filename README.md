# Dust Scaling Tests

First compile and run the IC's using MUSIC in the music directory.

Second, download and compile GIZMO with and without dust in the test directory.

Third, run the IC's to redshift z=3.2 both with and without.

Once completed, restart from last snapshot with varying number of nodes and OPENMP threads, running from z=3.2 to z=3.0.
